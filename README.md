# Digital Hemmer-O-Graph
## Museum: Hirshhorn
## Activity: Maker Mornings

## Project:
Create a Public Engagement activity to explain the technology used in Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's <i>Pulse</i>
Exhibition at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC.
Activity occured every Saturday at the museum from 10am-1pm in December 2018. 
Geared toward families with young children, but open to any museum-goer.

Building on the idea of generative bio-art of Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's <i>Pulse</i> exhibit, 
I developed a few applications using similar ideas. With the finger pulse sensor used in the <i>Pulse Tank</i> 
installation, two visitors at a time take their individual beats per minute, which are then used used as 
variables, processed by a Lissajous algorithm, which produces a lissajous pattern based on the inputs. 
Animated Lightening Bug sprites then follow the path, referencing Lozano-Hemmer's <i>Pulse Room</i> in a child-like way.
